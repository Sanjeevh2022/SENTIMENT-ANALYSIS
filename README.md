# THE TEKHUB PROJECT
The TekHub project is part of an active research collaboration between RIT and the local senior living community, Jewish Senior Life (JSL). The dataset documenting over 1500 interactions between seniors living at JSL and RIT-provided tech support was analyzed to find answers to the following questions:
a. Which technologies are seniors struggling with the most? Why?
b. What tasks are seniors trying to do?
c. How do the above interact?
d. How are these factors changing over time?
To answer the questions above, the questionnaire resulting in this dataset was studied carefully. I have approached the problem by studying each variable by generating as many
questions as possible about the variable, and its interactions with other variables, to generate meaningful insights. The study was divided into the following sections:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Natural Language Processing
4. Insights/Conclusion
